- Occurs at all stages of life

Looking-Glass Self
- We learn who we are by interacting with others
- Sense of self can only be developed through comparison to peers and others
	- we imagine how we appear to others
	- how others evaluate us
	- develop feelings about ourselves such as respect or shame based on the impressions we believe others have of us

Mead's Stages of Development
1. Preparatory stage: birth-2years old; imitates others
	- Significant others: people who play important roles in socialization
2. Play stage: 2-6 years old; pretend to be other people
	- Role taking: mentally assuming the perspective of another, thereby enabling the person to respond from the imagine viewpoint
3. Game stage: 7 years old; considers several tasks & relationships simultaneously
	- Generalizing other: a person's image of cultural standards that they then apply to themself to get their sense of self
