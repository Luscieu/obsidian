What to know about socialization:
- It's role in society
- How symbolic interactionism contributes
- How socialization occurs throughout the course of life

Socialization: the process whereby people learn the attitudes, values, and actions appropriate to individuals as members of a particular culture

Nature versus nurture debate
- e.g. studies on isolation
- Findings point to a mix between heredity <u>**and**</u> environment
- Epigenetics - interrelationship between genes & environment

#### Self & Socialization
- The symbolic interactionist perspective is most influential in the theoretical perspective in informing understanding of socialization
- Explains how individuals develop and modify their sense of self and acquire an understanding of culture through social interactions
- Self: consists of your ideas and attitude about who you are as a independent being
- Occurs at all stages of life

Looking-Glass Self
- We learn who we are by interacting with others
- Sense of self can only be developed through comparison to peers and others
	- we imagine how we appear to others
	- how others evaluate us
	- develop feelings about ourselves such as respect or shame based on the impressions we believe others have of us

Mead's Stages of Development
1. Preparatory stage: birth-2years old; imitates others
	- Significant others: people who play important roles in socialization
2. Play stage: 2-6 years old; pretend to be other people
	- Role taking: mentally assuming the perspective of another, thereby enabling the person to respond from the imagine viewpoint
3. Game stage: 7 years old; considers several tasks & relationships simultaneously
	- Generalizing other: a person's image of cultural standards that they then apply to themself to get their sense of self

#### The Presentation of Self
- Impression management altering of the presentation of the self in order to  create distinctive appearances and to satisfy particular audiences 
- Face-work: efforst of people to maintain a proper image and avoid embarrassment

Primary Socialization: The childhood socialization within the family
Secondary Socialization: learning that occurs after primary socialization, influenced by other agents of socialization (e.g. friends, teachers)

Rites of Passage: rituals marking the symbolic transition from one social position to another
- can be formal or informal; private or public
- each status change has new rules, roles, privileges, expectations, and relationships
- Social devaluation: a situation where a person or group is considered to have less social value

Aging & Society
- Age defines what is appropriate for and expected of people at each stage in life
- Status based relativity - what is normal at one age might not be normal for another
- Chronological Age - The age of a person since birth
- Functional Age - The age of a person, we assume through physical features, mental abilities, characteristics, habits, and behaviour

Anticipatory Socialization: beginning to take on the norms and behaviours of roles to which we aspire
- e.g. high school students prep for uni
- associated mainly with adolescence

Resocialization: the process in which powerful socializing agents deliberately cause rapid change in peoples' values, roles, and self conception, sometimes against their will
- e.g. think assimilation and residential schools

Toal Institutions: Complete isolation from larger society. Under strict control and supervision.
e.g. prison
- All aspects of life are under control
- Others are in same circumstances (aside from specialized staff)
- Rules and schedules made and forced upon participants
- Provides for basic needs of its members
- Strips people of their individuality
- Uses degradation ceremonies to humiliate people making them less rebellious and more conforming
