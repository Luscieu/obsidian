##### Social Construction of Reality: 
process by which our perception of reality is shaped by the intersubjective (shared subjective opinion of belief) meaning we give to an experience
- meaning in the world is created through our interactions
- we can only see the world as we feel and interpret it, not how the world actually is
- interacting within a pre-defined social structure is what develops our understanding of our reality
- the extent to which a group can define social structure and reality reflects the group's power

##### Social Interaction: 
how "role performers" act in relation to others
- includes communication between people interacting and reacting to one another
- Mediated Interaction: is communication that uses technologies, mediums, or platforms to communicate (non verbal, present methods of interaction, such as texting
	- mediated in that some aspects of the interaction are lost, example in texting, there is less tone, volume, or mood, especially without knowing context on the people and their relations)

##### Social Structure:
stable patterns of social relations
