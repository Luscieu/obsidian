##### Social Construction of Reality: 
process by which our perception of reality is shaped by the intersubjective (shared subjective opinion of belief) meaning we give to an experience
- meaning in the world is created through our interactions
- we can only see the world as we feel and interpret it, not how the world actually is
- interacting within a pre-defined social structure is what develops our understanding of our reality
- the extent to which a group can define social structure and reality reflects the group's power
	- to create a fictional structure that all people can believe in allows us to cooperate and binds us together, allowing us to have a shared reality, whereas other animals communicate solely to describe reality
		- e.g. money/currency

##### Social Interaction: 
how "role performers" act in relation to others
- includes communication between people interacting and reacting to one another
- Mediated Interaction: is communication that uses technologies, mediums, or platforms to communicate (non verbal, present methods of interaction, such as texting
	- mediated in that some aspects of the interaction are lost, example in texting, there is less tone, volume, or mood, especially without knowing context on the people and their relations)

##### Social Structure:
stable patterns of social relations
- Makes social interactions and relationships predictable based on environment and context
- Provides a predefined framework and expectation for interaction

##### Statuses:
a culturally defined position or social location
- Involves rights (privilege), duties, and expectations
- Status set - the current statuses a person has at the time
- Ascribed status - status defined at birth
- Achieved Status - status achieved through efforts and choices

##### Master Status:
the main social position/status that defines one's social identity
- supersedes other statuses
- confers high/low levels of personal worth on people

##### Status Cues:
visual indicators of others' social position
- pride in status - use visible means to let others know about one's status, e.g. flaunting wealth via luxury products, a badge, certificate, or piece of clothing indicating position
- announce our accomplishments and facilitate interactions with others and how you should be treated

##### Roles:
clusters of expectations about beliefs and actions appropriate for a person of particular status
- whereas we occupy a status, we play a role
	- Role-playing: we conform to the associated role and existing performance expectations after or as we take up a position
- Role-making: process by which individuals generate role expectations
- Role Ambiguity: expectations associated with a role are unclear
- Role Set: set of various roles attached to a single status, e.g. father has a role of teaching the children, being a good husband, changes relations with other women, typically calls for a man to make money
- Role Conflict: incompatibility among roles of different statuses e.g. mother and employee status conflicts with the roles of each
- Role Strain: incompatibility among roles of a single status e.g. professor had roles for teaching, publishing, and departmental service
- Role Exit: disengagement from master status associated role and establishment(or reestablishment) in a new role
	- stages:
		1. Doubt
		2. Search for alternatives
		3. Action or departure
		4. Creation of new identity
	- can be involuntary or voluntary, public or private

#### Self-fulfilling Prophecy:
an expectation that plays a role in bringing about what it predicts
- status labels -> roles -> expectations -> a person internalizing said expectations, and it becoming real
	- e.g. blue eye brown eye experiment where students are told they are smart or dumb, or zimbardo prison study, where students play role of prisoner or guard
- Can be in either a positive or negative direction

##### Ethnomethodology:
the study of how people make sense of what others do and say by adhering to pre-existing norms
- background expectancies - people's shared interpretation of objects and events leading to an expected action
- breaching experiment: break presumed background expectancies of the situation to observe people's responses
