Social Construction of Reality: process by which our perception of reality is shaped by the intersubjective (shared subjective opinion of belief) meaning we give to an experience
- meaning in the world is created through our interactions
- we can only see the world as we feel and interpret it, not how the world actually is
- interacting within a pre-defined social structure is what develops our understanding of our reality
- the extent to which a group can define social structure and reality reflects the group's power
