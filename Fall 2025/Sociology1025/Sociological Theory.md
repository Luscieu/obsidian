Origins of Sociology
- Born from 3 major revolutions
	- The scientific revolution
		- Evidence based knowledge
		- Methods of discovery
			- Scientific methods
	- The democratic revolution
		- Discovery that people control society
			- Shifted belief from religion and god controlling the social world to people
				- People who were of high status were believed to be close to god, which explained their wealth and privilege
	- The industrial revolution
		- industrialization and urbanization created new social problems
			- Land was claimed, fieldworkers lost their lifestyle, people moved towards cities, labor started to become mechanized, and people had less part in what they worked
			- Working conditions had people and children dying
				- Caused family disruption, where men and children would die, leaving a widow which would otherwise be uncommon, as divorce was taboo

Auguste Comte
- Coined term sociology
	- from latin socius (meaning social, being with others) and logos (study of)
- Believed there were two social forces
	- social statics: to keep society stable and orderly
	- social dynamics: to disrupt/change the order
- His goal was to reorganize society to become the secular non religious priests of society and better society
- Positivism - Belief that the world is best understood through scientific inquiry
- Natural science model
	- criticized as social science is not as clear as natural science
	- social science is much more complex and constantly evolving
	- social science has ethics and code of conducts
	- the act of studying society can often change how society functions
- Despite how much more complex social science is compared to some natural science, human behaviours is still very much patterned and predictable

Contemporary sociologists view:
- Stability
	- People looking for stability in life
- Competition
	- People competing for money, resources, opportunity
- Symbolic interactionism
	- To understand society you must look at how each interaction becomes symolic to people and how it changes their perspective and how they interact with the world
- Gender inequality

Theory: a tentative (non permanent, ever changing) explanation of some aspect of social life that states how and why certain facts are related
- Each theory creates a model of how it believes the world to work

Emile Durkheim
Functionalist Perspective:
- Society is a stable orderly system
	- Characterized by consensus
		- Similar values, normals, and code of conduct
- Believes each part of society serves its own function
- Focuses on how to maintain social order, which is key to understand society
- Looks at how social structures, such as institutions(education, family, criminal justice, etc.) connect and depend on each other serving functions that are necessary for society as a whole to function
	- Generally agreed upon most important institution is family, saying that if the family does not properly socialize their children, the children grow up with problems and create problems in society

Talcott Parsons (another functionalist)
- Societies must make provisions for meeting social needs in order to survive
- Family division of labour is essential
	- Distinct specialized task in the family
		- "Instrumental tasks"
			- earning money
			- decision making
		- "Expressive tasks"
			- raising and taking care or children

Prof's perspective:
- There needs to be **A** distinct division of tasks
	- Could be applied to the rest of society

Robert Merton: Manifest and Latent functions (ANOTHER FUNCTIONALIST)
- Manifest functions
	- Intended obvious functions
- Latent functions
	- Less obvious
	- or even unintended functions

Conflict Perspective:
- Society is not a cohesive system
- Sees society as an arena of conflict and power struggle
- people compete for resources to further their own agenda at the expense of others
- Sees most conflicts aside from rich v.s. poor as distractions made to blur the issue
- Says that all institutions are made to keep the rich and powerful at the top
	- Education: Teaches people to follow rules and instructions made by those in power
		- Education differs based on class
	- Legal system: Punishment can be evaded based on class

Karl Marx:
- Focused on
	- Struggle between social classes and that conflict
		- Bourgeoisie and Proletariat
		- Bourgeoisie have the means of production
		- Proletariat sell their labor for those with the means of production
		- Bourgeoisie exploit proletariat paying less than what their labor was worth as the bourgeoisie had options as to who they hire and they had all the leverage in the relationship
	- Capitalism and how it is the issue
		- Capitalism would bring itself down
	- Proletariat would feel alienated by the unfair pay
		- Would become class conscious, realizing that the bourgeoisie is the reason they suffer
		- Would then overthrow the bourgeoisie and establish free & classless society

Symbolic Interactionist Perspective:
- Focuses on everyday life interactions and how that changes peoples perspective and gives meaning to each interaction in our social reality
- Symbol: Anything that meaningfully represents something else
	- Language is considered a main symbol (specifically each word)
		- Similar understanding of each word leads to a shared reality
- We live in an world of objects, where an object is anything you can make reference to
	- each object has no inherit meaning nor an objective one
- Is very much a microsociological perspective, where other theories such as conflict and functionalist theory are macrosociological perspectives

Herbert Blumer:
- Human beings act toward things in the basis of meanings they have for **them** specifically
- Meanings develop through social interactions
- Meaning making is an interpretive process

Mead & Cooley:
- Notions of self are made possible through communicating with other
	- Hard to look at yourself unless there are others to compare yourself to
- Language is the common understanding

Erving Goffman
- Dramaturgical analysis - life is a social performance
	- We are "actors", trying to be the person others think we are, fitting their expectations, and making it seem like we have everything together
	- When we deviate from these expectations, things get awkward


Symbolic Interactionist Perspective
- Meaning, as it is shared, becomes relied upon and more fixed
- Once people accept certain aspects in society as "real", real consequences flow from that reality
- "If people define situation as real, then they are real in their consequences," The W.I. Thomas Thereom
- Encourages us to challenge taken for granteds
