Deviance is relative to culture, history and time, context or situations, status
- The line between deviant and non-deviant can be ambiguous

Functionalist Perspective:
- Normal part of human existence, with both positive and negative consequences for stability
- Positive aspects:
	- Social solidarity, unites conformist group
	- Sets clears boundaries, reinforces them
	- Raises value of conformity
	- Innovation
Strain Theory:
- assumption: society promotes legimate goas and means to achieve them
- e.g. goal:success/means:hard work
- 5 forms of adaptation:
	- Conformity
	- Innovation: reject the mean, but agree with goal
		- e.g. drug dealer
	- Ritualism: accept the mean, but disagree with the goal
		- e.g. happy getting by
	- Retreatism: reject both the mean and the goal
		- e.g. fall out of society give up
	- Rebellion: reject both the mean and goal and replace them
- Strain theory happens when /there is a gap between the means and the goals, which leads to deviance

Interactionist theory:
Differential association theory
- criminal behaviour is learnt through cultural transmission
- deviant associations -> deviant attitudes -> deviant behaviour

Labeling theory
- deviance is not a quality it is a label that gets applied
- labels can become a self-fulfilling prophecy
- application and internalization of labels
- deviant label can then become a master status
