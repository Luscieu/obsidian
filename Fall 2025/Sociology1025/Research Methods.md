Quantitative Research Model:
--
- Precise measurement
- Numbers and statistics
- Assumes that the social world is objective and can be reduced to numbers
- Uses deductive reasoning, begins with general ideas that have their validity tested on specific cases
	- Idea->Survey->Cases

- Step 1: Defining the problem
	- Having a clear idea of what you want to study
	- Operationalize: the process of translating concepts and ideas into measurable variables, and turning proposition into hypothesis
- Step 2: Reviewing the literature
	- Literature: Relevant scholarly studies and information that pertain to subject of research
	- Purpose? Refines the problem under study, clarifies possible techniques to be used in collecting data, eliminates or reduces avoidable mistakes
- Step 3: Formulating the Hypothesis
	- Hypothesis: The testable form of a proposition
	- Variable: measure of a concept that has more than one value or score
	- Independent Variable: the presumed cause in a cause and effect relationship
	- Dependent Variable: the presumed effect in a cause and effect relationship
	- Causal Logic: the idea that there is a variable that causes another, and that it follows a certain direction, the dependent variable not always having or not having an effect on the independent variable
	- Correlation: A relationship between two or more variables whereby a change in one coincides with a change in another
- Step 4: Selecting the Research Design
	- Determine how the data will be collected and analyzed
	- Decide what kind of sample will be used
		- Ensure the sample is statistically representative of the population
		- Probability Sample: every member of a population has a known and nonzero chance of being selected
		- Random sampling assists in achieving a representative sample
		- Sampling frame: a list of everybody in the population from which one would plan to draw the sample from
- Step 5: Data Collection
	- The main sociological data collection techniques include
		- Experiments
		- Surveys
		- Field research
		- Secondary sources
- Step 6: Data Analysis
	- What does the data tell you about social life?
	- Interpret trends and themes, look for relationships between variables
	- Ensuring the validity and reliability of data
		- validity: the degree to which results reflect reality
		- reliability: yield consistent results
- Step 7: Developing the Conclusion
	- Based on your analysis, what conclusions can be made?
	- Accepting or rejecting the hypothesis:
		- Data generated does not always need to support hypothesis

Qualitative Research Model:
--
- Observation, description and interpretation of peoples' behaviour
- Assumes reality is intersubjectively constructed: subjectively known, but influenced by others
- Inductive reasoning: begin with concrete cases and proceed to identify general patterns
- Data Collection -> Theorizing -> Conclusion

Similar to quantitative, but has some unique features:
1. General approach is taken, not a highly detailed plan
	- Good for initial study, allows exploration rather than a constricted or biased view
2. Mainly how and what questions, not so much why. More descriptions than explanations
3. Decide when the literature review and theorizing should take place
4. Presents a detailed view of the topic
	- Opinionated, less objective
	- Detailed description of what occurred or what was observed

Research Methods
--
Quantitative
- Generally surveys and experiments
Qualitative
- Typically field research

Experiment: carefully controlled artificial situation that allows researchers to isolate hypothesized causes and precisely measure their effects
- Subjects matched or randomly assigned to experimental or control group
- Types: 
- laboratory
- natural - taking advantages of a natural real life situation to see how people act)
- field - staged experiment

Strengths and Weakness of Experiments:
Strengths:
- Researcher Control
- Time and Cost effectiveness
- Replication strengthens validity and generalizability with other groups
- Reliability through multiple experiments
Weaknesses:
- Artificiality of lab setting 
	- may alter results
	- Also causes one to question how applicable it is to extrapolated situations
- Subject reactivity
	- Knowledge of being studied
- Small numbers of variables can be tested at a time

Surveys: A study, generally in form of an interview or questionnaire, which provides information concerning how people think and act.
- Respondents asked identical questions
- Typically very structured, standardized, and closed-ended questions
- Open-ended questions: opportunity to answer the question in their own words
	- Allows full consideration
	- Harder to analyze/categorize
- Closed-ended questions: choice of answers, true/false, yes/no
	- Easier to categorize
	- Less consideration
	- Not everyone may feel their answer is represented

Strengths and Weakness of Survey:
Strengths:
- Useful for describing the characteristics of a large population 
- Generalizability
- Standardized approach = reliability
Weaknesses:
- Standardized questions tend to force responses into categories in which they may not belong
- Can be weak on validity
- Sometimes not good for sensitive issues

Field Research: the study of social life in its natural setting; observing and interviewing where people live, work, and play
- Qualitative data: most observations are best described verbally rather than numerically
- Purposive and snowball sampling
	- Purposeful selection of participants
	- Selection may continue through referral of initial participants
- Observation: Researcher systematically observes social process, but does not take part in it
- Participant Observation: Collecting systematic observations while being part of the group that is being studied 
	- Question of how much you want to participate
- Ethnography: a detailed study of the life and activities of a group of people by researchers who may be heavily involved or live with that group for extended periods of time
- In depth Interview: an extended, unstructured, or semi structured, open ended interaction between an interviewer and an interviewee
	- Follows general plan but is flexible
	- General or lead in questions to start the interview
	- Key is to carefully listen to the participants experiences

Strengths and Weaknesses of Field Research:
Strengths:
- Insider view
- Social life as it takes place in natural setting
- Studying social processes and change over time
- Meanings people attribute to their everyday lives
- Validity
Weaknesses:
- Very involved - time consuming, demanding, possibly dangerous
- Hard to generalize and not reliable to replicate

Research Ethics
--
Ethical Consideration
1. Voluntary Participation
2. Harm minimization
3. Right to privacy
4. Authenticity
- Informed consent
- Right to leave
