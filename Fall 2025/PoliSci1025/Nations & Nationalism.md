Ethnic groups: Community claiming common language, religion, ancestry

Nation:
- Categorization
- Comradeship
- Commitment to political autonomy, usually statehood
	- The ability to govern themselves and determine our own livelihood

Patriotism: Commitment to the nation

Nationalism:
- Sense of the integrity and value of that nation community
- Commitment to the nation's political aspirations
	- e.g. healthcare, gun laws

National identity: group characteristics and political aspirations

Nation-state: state boundaries match national community: rare as most are multi-national

National self-determination : principle supporting creation of nation-states
- Less so today, as we see it more as just having a state to reside in for a group of largely diverse individuals who exist within a categorization

Cultural Nationalism:

Nation = ethnic foundations
- Herder: "natural" and durable
- Smith: adapted to modernity - e.g. German efficiency being a characteristic of their beliefs

Justification for national liberation struggle

Exclusive
- To become part of the nation there may be a set of conditions to one, enter the country with the intention to stay, and two, become a citizen, or even three, become part of the cultural nation

Why Cultural not Ethnic?
- Ethnicity substitutes for race
- Key subjective component

Kwame A. Appiah: "History may have made us what we are; but the choice of a slice of the past in a period before your birth as your own history is exactly that: a choice"

Political Nationalism:
- Nation constructed on foundations of state:
	- Borders
	- Citizenship
	- Self-government
	- Political principles
- Common in established states
- Inclusive, assimilationist
	- To have the same values to be in the same "group"
- The nation is constructed
	- Eric Hobsbawn says nations are invented traditions: Traditions that make one a part of a group or nation. The nation is a collection of traditions that the majority of the group share
	- Benedict Anderson calls it an imagined community: You 'feel' like you are part of the community but there is nothing that actually determines that

Varieties of nationalism:
1. Liberal nationalism
	- Individual and collective freedom
	- Equal nation-states that exist, support each other, and coexist
2. Conservative nationalism
	- Existing national community = natural, cohesive
	- Defends own nation against all threats
		- Defence against those who have other values
3. Expansionist nationalism
	- Culturally or racially defined national community
	- Strives to complete national integration by incorporating other territories of similar cultural/race
4. Anti and post -colonial nationalism
	- Defined by **colonial** boundaries
	- Imperfect nation self determination necssary to hold the group together

Brief History of Nationalism
- french revolution
	- national sovereignty
	- mass conscription
		- introduction of the idea that you must fight for your own nation
	- spurred nationalist raction of rivals, those who did not think they were part of the nation
	- declaration of the rights of man and the citizen
		- the principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in the nation
- ww1
	- collapse of major empires
	- released national self determination (or national energies) where people wanted to be part of the state that represented their own people, as well as though that were similar to them
	- idea that the path to peace is if every group had their own nation to take care of themselves
- ww2
	- question was who was in and out of each group? what determined who was part of the group or not
	- fight started as many people of different ethnic and cultural backgrounds were displaced, but people wanted to govern and take care of their own people
	- how could you sort or separate these people
		- often required force, or ethnic cleansing
- european states weakened by war
	- led to decolonization where people were brought back to a country as they were considered "their" people
	- european integration

summary:
- nation and nationalism: WHO
	- is part of it, who gets to decide, vote, be protected, have a say, consent
- how do we decide who
	- political ideas about exclusion, culture,etc.
	- political institutions how history has changed, evolved, and devolved how people become part of a nation, and how nationalism is created
- Each ideology will make some claims about the political values of each group
