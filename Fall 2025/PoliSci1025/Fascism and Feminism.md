	- The state would be lead by a powerful leader of military background
- Modern - In italy in early 20th century
	- Attack on socialism and liberalism
	- Focuses on the nation rather than its people or the individual

Fascism:
- Yes capitalism
- No individualism, no science (nonenlightenment)
- Nationalism
	- full loyalty to the nation
- Elitism
	- Certain people are the elite, chosen ones
	- Important to note that they are anti-elitism in that they do not think well of the elites of individualism and politics in liberalism
- Totalitarian
	- Everything under control of state and its leader
	- Surveilled state
- Reactionary
	- not supporting knowledge and enlightenment
- Cult of leadership
	- built around one major leader

#### Mussolini's Fascism
- National unity
- Liberalism - no, people should not be free to do what they want, they should be obedient and loyal to the state
- Leader leads through celebration of war and violence
- Individuals can be sacrificed for the state, worship the state

#### Hitler's Nazism
Two explanations for Hitler's rise to power
- Economic situation of Germany after WW1, his solution to get the economy better
- Charismatic enough to be the major leader
	- Lead people to become one
		- the state becomes one
			- people did not care what he planned to do with power, only knowing they wanted to work for him

- Resentment towards other countries as a result of end of WW1
	- gives rise to national unity against others
- German people ("Volk") must defeat Jews, Communists, and Liberals who promote ideas of universal brotherhood
- Need a leader
- Nationalism - Gave people the idea that Germans were superior to others and should not be under "lesser people"
	- Germans should be ruled over by German people, people displaced in the war should be brought back
- Social Darwinism
	- Some people are better than others, which should be invested in, the others should be removed (Racism and anti-Semitism)
	- Led to Final Solution and the Holocaust
	- What differentiates Nazism from Fascism

Paxtons key themes:

### Feminism
Gender = social constructions of masculinity and femininity 
- sex $\ne$ gender, sex is physical
- imposed by society
- may be chosen by individuals
	- expression of identity
- Elimination subordination of women (such as patriarchy)
- Against patriarchy as a natural system

Tradition view:
- Politics is public
- Family & personal relationships are private
- "Public man" dominates the state, education, and the economy, and the family
- "Private woman" restricted to home and family

Feminist view:
- "personal is political"
	- public and private not divided as much as one thinks
	- Empowerment of women needed = political action & changes (e.g. domestic violence, rape, jobs, education)

Feminists Justice:
- Equality
	- Liberals seek equality: everybody treated the same as individuals, before the law, opportunities
- Difference
	- Conservatives seek maintaining differences as essential to society: women should focus on taking care of the family as a mother
- Equity
	- Radical & Socialists seek liberation: seek fairness in power relationships: society & economics & political structures

Liberal Feminism:
- Overcome overt discrimination
	- e.g. opportunites available to men (political, education, etc.)
- Change laws and institutions 
- Goal: equalize opportunities for men and women

Socialist Feminism:
- Capitalism creates patriarchy through the system of inequality artificially created through capitalism
- "pink collar" jobs
- feminization of labour:
	- more women in that industry
	- men are pushed out
	- wages and working conditions go down
	- lack of women union allows costs to go down, and profits to go up
- double burden/day - women end up doing both housework and work outside the home for income

Radical Feminism:
- Patriarchy leads to capitalism and other systems
- Overcome sexist attitude and beliefs
	- women internalize harmful attitude and false beliefs
- Emphasize women's differences, should not be used to make patriarchy natural
	- should empower them, give them choices, and equity in their differences
- Overthrow Patriarchy:
	- Male bias in the debate over rules in society
	- Empower women locally through insitutions, family, sexuality, and individuality
- Liberation more than political and economical
	- release from control
		- sexualities
		- reproductive rights
		- family violence
		- workplace harassments
		- sexual violence
