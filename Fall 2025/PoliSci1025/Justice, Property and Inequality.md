Democracy - every country has its own claim at being a democratic country

Aristotle - Father of European/Western political science
He says polisci is the "master science" as it determines the rest
- determines community, permissible actions, lives
Humans are social animals, but the highest of humanity are political animals
- Politic animals would refer to the ones with power that can control what happens, whether that is mistreating, abusing, supporting, educating, or killing

Two key questions in polisci: about power
1. Who gets what?
2. Says who?

Politic Context:

- Global investors choose to invest in Canada as the politics are stable, the laws are mainly abided, and Canadians are considered polite/meek/pushovers

Three types of questions in social sci:
1. How are things?
2. Why are things this way?
3. How should things be?

Evidence v.s. Normative?
- The reality v.s. what is made normal
- Example was assault and how reality has it so there are essentially none convicted to it, and how nothing happens to those who commit it, and yet how we have gbsv training

distributive Justice:
- Who should get what?
- What should be distributed?
- Money? Opportunity? Rights? Housing? Labour?
	- On opportunity: tuition for class holds back people, despite the space still in the class

Property rights: of objects, land, buildings, factories
- Owners of resources have rights (albeit limited in many cases) as to what they do with it
- right to possess (exclude from others), use, sell, give, destroy
- How do you create "property"?

Marx:
- Money changes human relations
	- It perverts everything
- Money becomes a means for procuring everything
- Money talk debases our language
	- Everything becomes about making money
	- Converts everything into monetary value
Historically, conquest, enslavement, robbery, murder, in short, force is the greatest factor in creating property

What justifies a system of property rights?
- Promoting Utility
	- Purpose or benefit to a society or culture
- Securing Natural rights
- Securing freedom
	- Preventing anybody from controlling another with ease
- Ensuring equality

What does utilitarianism say about property rights?
- Important for maximization of happiness and well being
- Driven by theory of impartiality
	- Everybody should have equal concern and importance
Diminishing marginal utility - When one has too much, it becomes less valuable, and should be distributed through the system

Libertarianism:
- Right to property should be absolute
	- Disagrees with property tax or being forced to redistribute by renting out

Liberal Egalitarianism:
- Unrestricted free markets generate unacceptable inequalities
- Committed to freedom for all
- Believe redistribution can equalize freedom
- AGAINST free market as the power they hold can influence others to give themselves to great of an advantage that will create more inequality
	- e.g. buying out companies for monopoly

Rousseau's View: Founder of civil society
- Fruits and boons of earth should belong to all of us
- Earth itself belongs to nobody
- believes that each should have the ability to attain what everybody else can to survive
	- that all should have a goal, otherwise society goes into chaos
		- that goal needs to be achievable in society rather than impossible

Nozick's 3 principles: Theory of property rights
1. Justice in initial acquisition, how ownership originates
	- e.g. claiming land
2. Justice in transfer, making the exchange legitimate
	- e.g. conquest is that legit?
3. Rectification of injustice, what should be done to correct unjust acquisition?
	- e.g. how to correct indigenous injustices

Locke: Property from survival
- Needs property to survive
	- food, shelter
	- Property of what is necessary
		- Apples sure, but not the entire tree
	- Leave some for others
- Does not generate property rights or how we come to own things
Labour Mixing arugument:
- Individuals own themselves and their labour/work
	- e.g. you grow the apple tree, you own the tree
- Property originates when mixing labour with unowned nature
	- Unclear as to how much work is needed to make a claim to something
	- Unfair to those who cannot work
Argument from desert:
- Those who work productively deserve the fruits of their labour
- Again is unfair to those who cannot work or cannot find work, only justifies value added
Upshot of Locke's arguments:
- It is difficult to justify an account of acquisition

Four questions of market:
1. Who owns what?
2. Why do people produce?
3. How are goods distributed?
4. What determines which goods get produced?

Capitalist free market:
- Private property rights
- Production for profit
- Distribution by voluntary exchange, people choose what they buy
- Free competition

Planned Economy:
- State owns all major property
- Production for needs rather than profit
- Distribution by central allocation and needs, not entertainment but only needs
- State controls what gets produced

Modified free market:
- State owned enterprises
- Sale of some goods is prohibited or limited
- Some state enforce monopolies - state licenses necessary
- Some voluntary distribution - charity
- Market conveys information of shortage and surplus
- Profit provides incentive and evolution and adaptation of market to fill needs
- Market failure- cost/benefit of producing is externalized - waste or outsourced labour - lamps
- Leads to manipulation of interests to create a wanted product for profit


**Hypothetical social contract: The "perfect" politician in power**
- Politics decide the rules that allow us to live together
- Politicians should be in the original position of impartiality to have a veil of ignorance
- Veil of ignorance:
	- Shouldn't benefit self at the expense of others
- The one to decide society should be impartial
	- e.g. somebody who had amnesia and doesnt know where they lie in society and therefore cannot benefit themselves and aim to make everybody equal as they would have equal concern for all people
- Principles of institutions to guide people
Moderate scarcity:
- There are many things, but they are unaccessible or unnecessary to be reasonably wanted

Self respect: The ability to choose what they want in what they are free to have
- Not everything in their life can be decided for the purpose of giving them their needs
Choosing has constraints:
- Physical
- Logical
- Formal
	- Publicity: Must be made known to everybody
	- Finality: Cannot be changed easily or on a whim

Would want to maximize the minimum, focus on benefitting the worst
- Allow everybody to have a job
Principle of greatest equal liberty
- What should be given to one should be given to everybody
	- e.g. free 1% mark boost at the end
Principle of fair equality of opportunity
- the free 1% mark boost would have a condition such as completing an assignment by a certain time
Difference principle
- Giving those in worse situations a advantage to make them better off
	- e.g. progressive tax

What Rawl is arguing in a nutshell:
- Those born socially or naturally unlucky should benefit - Morally arbitrary differences
- Injustice is when an inequality doesnt benefit everyone
- Legimate inequalities have to benefit the worst off group
	- e.g. indigenous groups who are disadvantaged in our society should be given advantages

Nozick's Entitlement Theory:
- Patterns: need, ability, desert
	- No need for difference principle, will cause interference in peoples lives, it will simply occur naturally




Oversights of Justice:
- Political thought may:
	- overlook whole areas of social concern
		- overlooked may include
			- women
			- racial and ethnic minorities
			- physically or mentally challenged
			- lgbtq
			- foreigner
			- immigrants
			- future generations (Many politics focus on appeasing the largest audience such as baby boomers who can vote rather than an uncoming generation of people who cannot vote who choose not to often)
	- justify oppression as justice
- e.g. Mill rejected racism, but accepted colonialism which disregards others' cultures and heritage under the preconception that the ones being colonialized and assimilated are lesser than the ones ruling and therefore their lifestyles are forced to change as the ruling impose their own rules on what they see as lesser
- Justification for slavery was that you would be removing people from environment where they would not grow intellectually and have them instead be useful in doing labor

How are justice and racism connected?
- "The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color line"
- Du Bois: objects to skin color, hair texture, etc., as grounds for excluding people from sharing in "the opportunities and privileges of modern civilization"(Dub Bois, 1900)
- Racism in politics = permanent difference as rational for using power to treat other races unjustly
- Anti-racism:
	- challenge race as a category
	- challenge societies' institutions and attitudes

Disability and justice connection:
- Ableism
- Persons with a disability or challenge
	- Disability of challenge does not define a person
		- it becomes a part of their identity
- What counts as a disability?
	- this is a controversial and debatable topic
	- e.g. do deaf communities count as disabled?
- Disability being a misnomer(misrepresented name)
	- the understanding of disabilities are evolving
	- alternate terms: challenges, altabilities (people who develop alternate ways to go about how most people go about their daily lives)
- Medical model = should be treated medically
	- why can't that person just exist as they are
- Social model = society disables people
	- Political changes: laws, employment rules, accessibility requirements, multi-format teaching

- Justice and LGBTQ+
	- an identity group
	- sexual orientation and gender identity
	- legal discrimnation
	- problem of state sponsored homophobia
	- polyamory
		- divorce how assets are divided

What of justice beyond the state?
Cosmopolitanism = beyond
- Human moral equality
	- Justice for all
- National basics have no moral significance
- Proposes that justice most be extended around the world
	- Focus on the least advantaged

Defence of the state focusing on justice applying to only their own people
- Societies = schemes of social cooperation -> justice = distributing the cooperative surplus
- Value of state membership is shared citizenship where people are in the same scheme of social cooperation, and can therefore benefit from the cooperative surplus
- ruins the value of shared nationality:
	- our identity based on shared history, culture, and language

Summary:
- Justice: distributive justice: who gets what? and who decides or how is it decided
	- which rule/principle is best
- Property: how do we come to own stuff
- Inequality
