Scatterplot - a graphical display of relationship between two quantitative variables measured on the same individuals
- Data appears as points, with each axis of the graph representing one of the quantitative variables

Response variable - measures an outcome of a study
Explanatory variable - may explain or influence changes in response variable

Convention: explanatory variable - x axis
		response variable - y axis
	Title - Response vs. Explanatory

Overall pattern of scatterplots:
- Form: **(STRICTLY)** linear or nonlinear
- Direction: positive or negative association
- How closely the points follow form(strong, moderate, weak) - can apply even to non linear forms

Outlier - an individual data point that falls outside the overall pattern of the scatter plot

Correlation:
$$
r = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - \bar{x})(y_i - \bar{y})}{n-1(s_x)(s_y)}
$$
Multiplies difference between sample and average, produces positive correlation when x and y are both above or below average, indicating a increasing trend in y as x $->\infty$ 
 negative correlation when opposite occurs
 
correlation is:
- Symmetric
	- x and y and be swapped
- Invariant to scaling and translation

downsides to correlation:
- does not imply causation
- sensitive to outliers
- limited to linear relationships
- does not account for other variables
