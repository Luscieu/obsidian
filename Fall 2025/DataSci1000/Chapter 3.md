side note:
use mean and standard deviation for mostly symmetrical distributions, otherwise use median for center and quartiles for distribution


Density curve - the idealized underlying distribution of the data
-  $f(x)\geq0$ for all x ( the curve is always above or on the x-axis)
- The total area under the curve is exactly 1
	- Hard to calculate unless curve is linear, but then it's not a curve

mean - describes the balance point of the curve, the weighted average
median - the point when that splits the probability in 0.5 and 0.5
mode - maximum point(s) of the curve

Population - The group of people that fall under the category being studied
Sample - Set of people under said population group, does not encapsulate the entire population

parameter - observation made/numeric description of an attribute of the population
statistic - average of participants/numeric summary or description of the sample

Notation for Normal Distribution: N($\mu, \sigma$)

$\mu$ determines where the distribution lies
$\sigma$ determines how large the distribution is (how clustered that data is together)

- Normal distributions are
	- Symmetric
	- mean=median=mode
	- Bell-curve
- In a normal distribution
	- approx 68% of data falls within 1 std of mean
	- approx 95% within 2
	- approx 99.7% within 3![[Screenshot 2025-09-23 at 1.13.37 PM.png]]
